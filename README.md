# PHPPictureUploader

This application is a procedural PHP proof of concept.  It allows for session-based authentication, mysqli CRUD operations, and file uploads.  Users are able to 'log in' with first and last name, and then upload and edit their photos.  Validation logic only allows for png, svg, jpeg, or gif files.  Use the database creation and seed scripts.  

TODO: Put this application on heroku, and register a cloud-based db.
